"What is the ATLAS experiment?","The ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS) experiment is one of the general-purpose particle physics experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It is designed to study a wide range of physics phenomena, including the search for the Higgs boson, extra dimensions, and particles that could make up dark matter. ATLAS is the largest volume particle detector ever constructed and has been operating since 2008.",physics_general,easy
"How do I query datasets in AMI?","AMI (ATLAS Metadata Interface) can be queried using the pyAMI Python client or command-line tools. First, set up your environment with 'lsetup pyami'. You can search for datasets using commands like 'ami list datasets --project data22_13p6TeV' or use Python API with ami.get_dataset_info(). Common query parameters include dataset name patterns, data type, project, and run numbers.",technical,medium
"What is the purpose of Rucio in ATLAS?","Rucio is the distributed data management (DDM) system used by ATLAS to manage data across the worldwide LHC computing grid. It handles data replication, deletion, and location tracking for petabytes of data stored at computing centers worldwide. Rucio allows physicists to download datasets, manage storage quotas, and ensure data availability for analysis.",technical,medium
"Explain the concept of luminosity in particle physics","Luminosity is a measure of the rate of collisions in a particle accelerator, typically expressed in units of inverse cross-section per unit time (e.g., cm⁻²s⁻¹). Integrated luminosity (measured in inverse femtobarns, fb⁻¹) represents the total number of collisions over a period and is crucial for determining the statistical significance of rare events. Higher luminosity means more collisions and better statistics for rare processes.",physics_general,medium
"What are the main subdetectors of ATLAS?","ATLAS consists of several key subdetector systems organized in cylindrical layers around the collision point: 1) Inner Detector (tracking system with pixel, SCT, and TRT detectors), 2) Electromagnetic Calorimeter (liquid argon sampling calorimeter), 3) Hadronic Calorimeter (tile and liquid argon calorimeters), 4) Muon Spectrometer (precision muon tracking chambers), and 5) Magnet System (solenoid and toroid magnets for particle bending).",physics_technical,hard
"How do I set up ATLAS software on lxplus?","On lxplus, ATLAS software is available via CVMFS. Start with 'setupATLAS' to initialize the environment. For analysis, use 'asetup <release>,<project>' to set up a specific release (e.g., 'asetup AnalysisBase,21.2.231'). For grid tools, use 'lsetup rucio' or 'lsetup panda'. Ensure you have a valid VOMS proxy with 'voms-proxy-init -voms atlas'.",technical,hard
"What is the difference between AOD and DAOD formats?","AOD (Analysis Object Data) is the primary ATLAS analysis format containing reconstructed physics objects and detailed information. DAOD (Derived AOD) formats are reduced versions optimized for specific analyses, containing only relevant objects and variables to reduce size and processing time. Common DAOD formats include PHYSLITE (lightweight physics objects) and various analysis-specific derivations like PHYS, EXOT, SUSY, etc.",technical,medium
"Describe the ATLAS trigger system","The ATLAS trigger system is a multi-level system that reduces the 40 MHz collision rate to ~1 kHz for permanent storage. It consists of: 1) Level-1 (L1) hardware trigger using calorimeter and muon detectors to reduce to ~100 kHz, and 2) High-Level Trigger (HLT) software-based trigger running on a computing farm that applies sophisticated algorithms to select interesting events. The trigger menus are configured based on physics priorities and luminosity conditions.",physics_technical,hard
"What statistical methods are commonly used in ATLAS analyses?","ATLAS analyses commonly use: 1) Maximum likelihood fits to extract signal yields and parameter values, 2) Profile likelihood for confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, 3) CLs method for exclusion limits (modified frequentist approach), 4) Bayesian methods for some searches, 5) BumpHunter algorithm for resonance searches, and 6) Multivariate techniques like BDTs and neural networks for signal/background discrimination. Systematic uncertainties are typically handled using nuisance parameters in the likelihood.",physics_analysis,hard
"How do I submit a grid job in ATLAS?","ATLAS uses PanDA (Production and Distributed Analysis) for grid job submission. First, set up with 'lsetup panda'. For analysis jobs, you can use pathena or prun commands. Example: 'prun --exec ""myScript.py"" --inDS input.dataset --outDS user.username.output'. Alternatively, use EventLoop or analysis frameworks that handle grid submission. Ensure you have a valid grid certificate and VOMS proxy before submitting.",technical,hard
